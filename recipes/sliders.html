    <h2>Beef Sliders by Chef John</h2>
    <p>Here is a recipe from Chef John on Allrecipes.com for making beef sliders!</p>

    <h3>Main Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>16 paper muffin liners</li>
        <li>Salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Secret Sauce Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons mayonnaise</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ketchup</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sweet pickle relish</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place ground beef onto a work surface; divide into 8 equal-size pieces...</li>
        <li>Sprinkle bottoms of paper liners with salt and black pepper. Form each piece of burger into a rough ball and place into a muffin cup. Season tops with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Place a second paper liner on top of each piece of meat and gently press it down to shape the mini burger into a round, flat shape. Pull off the paper tops and remove burgers from the muffin cups; remove bottom paper liners from burgers.</li>
        <li>Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Cook burgers in the hot skillet until they have a browned crust and are slightly pink in the middle, about 3 minutes per side. Flip burgers and cook 3 minutes on other side. Remove burgers to a plate to rest for 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Mix mayonnaise, ketchup, mustard, and pickle relish in a bowl; spoon a dollop onto each bun. Place burgers onto buns, season with more black pepper, and top with a tomato slice. Close buns and serve.</li>
    </ol>
